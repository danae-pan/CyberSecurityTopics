Our current issue is that the **DEPLOY_KEY** in the `cowrie.env` gets updated in every session of server deployment. The scripts that the website provides for honeypot deployment generate the **DEPLOY_KEY** every time but since we are not using this script but instead we add the cowrie service on the compose file we need to approach this differently. 

On the github repo with the source code of the chn server the `generateconfig.py` file points to the file that includes the generated environment values `config.py`. I found this file under the /opt folder in the chnserve container. The approach I took was to create an executable file that would run after the containers are up and running. This file copies the **DEPLOY_KEY** from the running chnserver container and uploads the value of **DEPLOY_KEY** in the `cowrie.env` file and finally restarts the cowrie container.
